FNM Distro
----------

This project takes fast node manager (FNM) distribution and makes it available in maven central.

For more information on fnm, please see [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm/)

# Motivation #

FNM does not currently provide a maven central distribution.  This project aims to solve that by providing users an alternative location to pull in maven friendly way.
